Alice2 grammar is the base grammar that shipped with Program-A the AIML 2. reference implementation written in
Java.

Its included in this project for completeness only and is not guaranteed to work at this time until, full testing
of both the grammar and Program-Y implemented is finished

If its anything like Alice, then its unlikely to be fully functional and will have broken and missing grammars
