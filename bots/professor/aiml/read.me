Using y-bot from https://github.com/keiffster/program-y by Keith Sterling , I have modified the professor bot aiml files  included with the distribution of program-y so it report no more error nor duplicates. 

Some files have been renamed in order for the linux python sorting operation to provided the expected priotiry of aiml grammar. 

The copyright including the rework remains the same as the original files.
