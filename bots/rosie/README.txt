This is the original Rosie AIML, produced by Pandora Bots, and hosted on GitHib https://github.com/pandorabots/rosie

Its broken, out of date and does not fully work. However it is included in Program-Y for completeness

If you are looking for a corrected version then check out rosie_fixed which is a fully working set of grammars
based on rosie AIML files
